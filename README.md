# SoloProject

#The idea:
	I will make a 'TODO LIST' project in 'react' framwork for front-end, with 'mongo' database and 'express' back-end.

#Implementaion:
	I will make a signup and login an logout criteria for every user,and after the this login, the user will go for the front-end page the "TODO LIST". He can add and remove.
